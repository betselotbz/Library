# Springboot Mini Project - Backend Library

## Project Descrip√•tion
This project is a backend library consisting of three main models: Genre, Book and User. It utilizes the H2 database and implements Spring Security along with JWT tokens for authentication and authorization. The application provides API endpoints for CRUD operations on genres and books, following REST conventions. It also handles exceptions and ensures implementation to KISS and DRY principles.

## Tools and Technologies
- Java
- Spring Boot
- H2 Database
- Spring Security
- JWT Authentication

## Approach
The project followed a structured approach:
1. **Database Models**: Defined three models: User, Genre, and Book, with their relationships.
2. **Authentication**: Implemented Spring Security and JWT tokens for secure API access.
3. **Controller-Service Pattern**: Divided the application into controllers and services for better organization.
4. **RESTful Endpoints**: Created CRUD endpoints for genres and books, following REST conventions.
5. **Exception Handling**: Implemented exception handling to provide meaningful error messages to users.
6. **Documentation**: Properly documented code with doc strings and inline comments.

## Unsolved Problems
Although the project is fully equipped with the essential backend components for seamless library access and management, it currently lacks specific CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations tailored to user-based access. Instead, the CRUD operations are implemented with a focus on genres and books.
